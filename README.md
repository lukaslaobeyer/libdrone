## libdrone

This small C++ library aims to provide a common interface to multirotor drones like the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 or the Parrot Bebop.
Most of the AR.Drone 2.0 communication code is taken directly from [AutoFlight](http://electronics.kitchen/autoflight) as an aim to decouple drone communications functionality from AutoFlight and provide an easy way add support for other devices.

### Supported Drones
Currently support is planned for the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 and Bebop.
* [AR.Drone 2.0](http://ardrone2.parrot.com)
* [Bebop drone](http://www.parrot.com/usa/products/bebop-drone/)

### Using the library

Work in progress!
